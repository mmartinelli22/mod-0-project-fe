## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
It was refreshing, but somewhat challenging. It was challenging in the way I didn't have something to tell me what exactly to code, like it was in section 1, but it was also nice because when I found the answer, I felt like I knew what I was doing and was much more confident about coding. The only slip ups I had this time around was remembering how to structure if statements.
2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
Arrays are probably used in things like youtube queue lists, facebook friends lists, anything that has a group of a data type in it like integers or strings.
3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
Array methods are like new functions that we can add to our arrays to create a different output when we log our results.
4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
A loop helps us go through our array and put out the index values. We would use a loop with our array if we needed to grab a certain element from our array. We would not use arrays if we had to find the value of something generic or print out multiple copies of something, instead of unique values.
5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
We use these loops to repeat code a certain number of times.Starting off, you create a starting point.Afterwards, you create how many times the code will loop. Then, you make sure that after the code has gone through an iteration, if the number of times looped isn't met, it continues to do so. Once you have looped through the code your set amount of times, you print out the results.
6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
Is there a better way to loop through this kind of stuff? I noticed that sometimes you can really mess up code or expected outcomes if you type out the wrong value or key. Will we learn about those things if there are?

## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I feel I wait too long, mainly because I am uncertain if the question is relevant enough to interrupt the presentation or the class going on.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
Numbers are the numerical integer for code.
Strings pretty much how you output words
Booleans are used to matchup data, and is how things like incorrect passwords happen.
3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment? "//" are comments in a javascript file. The purpose of a code comment is pretty much to provide reason and/or feedback to our code as developers.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is the name of the value we are using.
6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
Three variables that are probably used are name, which would be a string. passwords, which would be a boolean, and number of attempts, which would be a number.
7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
A concatenation is the combination of two variables.
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
I play a lot of video games, and I'm pretty sure developers use concatenation in dialogue when they need to bring up two named characters a lot, or use your characters name in an ability.
9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
What are all the languages we will end up learning? What are the punishments for late assignments?

## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you? One of the things that resonated with me is believing you can improve your coding skills with effort and practice. This is something I constantly tell myself, and is one reason why I love software development. It's constantly evolving and there's always something new to learn. O
One thing that resonated with me was the SMART goals. Having a kind of guideline to what kind of goals to set for yourself is nice, and keeping track of any goals I make by using the SMART acronym is something I will definitely do in the future.
2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
One thing I pride myself on is I am not afraid to ask questions if I don't 100% know what the subject at hand is. If I have any doubts, I will always express them if I feel like they need to be brought up. However, something I could work on is remembering mistakes are essential to learning. I am definitely one to beat myself up if I make a huge mistake - especially a big one- and will sometimes forget that in order to get better, I have to mess up.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
It felt fine, the only thing I really had to look back on was how to run a file in the terminal, it's not something I had remembered how to do. But using git, adding files and navigating through the terminal feels pretty familiar to me now and I'm pretty comfortable with it.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
A conditional statement is almost like  asking a question, and the computer giving the answer. If I use 6.23 to purchase something online, is that enough to pay for the item and shipping? If not, then I don't get the item. In life, a conditional I run into a lot is I need to get up and move around by a certain time or I won't move on throughout my day. If I sit down until about 7, I won't go workout or do my other hobbies, if I get around before then, I will definitely go out.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
To  add multiple conditions in an if statement, you need to add else. Essentially, the program checks if the if statement is met. If it is, it produces whatever value you tell it to. If it's not, it will go through else and follow those conditionals to see if they are met, if they are it will instead produce that value.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
In order to check these, we have operators. The I I && operator will check if two conditions are met, and the || will check if either condition is met.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
How do you know what to make the if statement about? It's pretty simple when you are told to do it, but when I do coding by myself, are there any tips to know when I should write and if statement and when I should just log something into the console?
